## How to compile and run the source code
- game name: Kernel Kingdom

There are two ways to run the program in the terminal. That is, to compile and run to the src directory - or make use of the class files generated from our IDE, which is Intellij


# COMPILING AND RUNNING
a. navigate to the src folder directory in the project kernel-kingdom/src

b. copy the following lines of instructions to compile the program
javac -d . com/kernelkingdom/model/*.java
javac -d . com/kernelkingdom/view/component/*.java
javac -d . com/kernelkingdom/view/*.java
javac -d . com/kernelkingdom/Main.java


c. lastly, run the program using the compiled Main class
java Main



Note:
- the source code (java files) is inside `src/com/kernelkingdom`
